The following people have contributed their blood and sweat to make
Catalyst::View::HTML::Zoom happen. Thanks everyone!

    * Thomas 't0m' Doran
    
        - Wrote the initial version and starting point

    * Oliver 'ocharles' Charles
    
        - Improved t0m's initial work and took over as maintainer

    * John 'jnap' Napiorkowski
        
        - Refactored most of the internals to make the view more workable
          and customizable in different projects
